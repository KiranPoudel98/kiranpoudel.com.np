You probably know how important it is to set up Google Analytics on your website since it helps you to analyze traffic and user behavior on your website. So in this article, I will be showing you how to set up Google Analytics on your website. 

Just follow the simple and easy steps as given below. Anyone can set up Google Analytics easily once going through this post. This will help bloggers who have just started or are going to start their blogging journey.

But before we begin, I am assuming that you already have a Gmail account. If not, then I request you to create a Gmail account as it is the most important factor in setting up Google Analytics.

So, let’s start the process.

## How To Set Up Google Analytics

**Step 1:** Log in to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin/signinchooser?service=analytics&passive=1209600&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.google.com%2Fanalytics%2Fweb%2F%23&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.google.com%2Fanalytics%2Fweb%2F&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin" target="_blank"><b>Google Analytics</b></a> with your Gmail.

**Step 2**: Click the **“Set up for free”** button.

**Step 7:** You will come across the UI as shown below. Tick the checkboxes as per your wish. (I would recommend you to **tick the first checkbox** and **click Save**.)

**Step 8:** You will be given the **Tracking ID and Global Site Tag** as shown below. Now, **copy the gtag.js script** and **paste inside the every <head>YourCodeHere</head>** section that you want to track in your **website root directory.**

Once you paste the code and upload it to your website’s root directory, Google Analytics on your website is installed.

**Repeat the same step up to 7 as above and copy the given gtag.js script as given in above step 8, and then do as instructed below.**

**Step 9:** Now, go to your **WordPress Dashboard.**

**Step 10:** Go to **Plugins** and click **Add New.**

Step 11: Now, search for Header and Footer Plugin and install any one and activate it. (I am using **Insert Headers and Footers plugin by WPBeginner**)		

**Step 12:** Now, again on the Dashboard, hover over or click the **Settings**, and click **Headers and Footers Plugin.**

Google Analytics now has been set up on your WordPress site. 

You can also **check whether Google Analytics is working or not**. You can **click the “Send Test Traffic” button** as shown below. It will redirect you to your website and then click on any of your posts or just navigate your website.

This means **Google Analytics has been successfully installed on your website.**

Now, go to your Google Analytics page and see the data.

Soon you will be able to see the analytics once traffic starts coming to your website.

You can learn more about Google Analytics since there are tons of tutorial videos, posts, etc., on Google and YouTube.
