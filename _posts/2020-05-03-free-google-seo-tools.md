In this article, I have prepared a list of free SEO tools developed by Google that everyone must use. I have also provided links to every tool.

The great part is that **these tools are absolutely free.**

So, let’s dive into it right away.

## 8 Free SEO Tools By Google

### Keyword Research Tools

**Content is King**. Yeah, you heard that right. You need to create killer content if you want to rank higher on search engines. High quality and unique content impact SEO tremendously. So, the content has become the very first choice of digital marketers. 

But, you need to **create content around keywords.** Because keywords are the bridge between the users and your content. Search engines never display your content until and unless your content matches the keywords the users are searching on search engines. So, keywords are very important if you want to increase the visibility of your content and rank higher on search engines.

So, let’s see some of the keyword research tools.

#### 1. <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank">Google Keyword Planner</a>

Google, the most popular search engine right now, has developed various free SEO tools and one of them is Google Keyword Planner. Almost everyone uses Google if they want their queries to be answered. So, what could be better than Google products to get the right keywords for your content?

You can use Google Keyword Planner if you don’t want to use premium tools like SEMrush, Moz, Ahrefs, and so on. It has a **huge keywords database.** You can get hundreds and thousands of keywords along with their search volume, competition, CPC, and many more. More interesting is that you can even search for keywords by entering the URLs of other websites. Isn’t it amazing? You can analyze the keywords of your competitors too.

You must use Google Keyword Planner to get the right keywords for your content.
